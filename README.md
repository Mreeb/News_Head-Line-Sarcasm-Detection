# News_Head-Line-Sarcasm-Detection
The dataset I am using is available at the Kaggle link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection, is called the "News Headlines Dataset for Sarcasm Detection." It is a collection of news headlines that have been labeled to indicate whether they are sarcastic or not.
